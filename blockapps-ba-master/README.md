### Pre Requisites

Node v7.2 or more recent.

This application requires a [BlockApps STRATO](http://blockapps.net/blockapps-strato-blockchain-application-development/) node. Follow the instruction in the [STRATO getting started guide](https://github.com/blockapps/strato-getting-started) to install a local instance.

Please make sure that ports 80, 3030, and 3031 are publicly accessible. If you are using AWS or Azure, you may need to allow traffic on these ports by changing the firewall settings.

Once you have a functional STRATO node, you can clone this project and deploy it to the STRATO instance using the instructions below.


### Dependencies

Install the dependencies

```
npm i
```

Install the UI dependencies

```
cd ui
npm i
```

### Deploying on Localhost

#### Uploading the smart contracts required by the demo app
 
If you are deploying using STRATO on `localhost` (Linux and Mac users only):
Run the following from the **project root**:

```
npm run deploy
```

Windows users should run

```
set "SERVER=localhost" & npm run deploy-windows
```

#### Launching the API

From the project root (Linux, Mac and Windows):

```
npm run start
```

#### Launching the UI

If you are deploying using STRATO on localhost (Linux and Mac users only):

```
cd ui
npm run start
```

On Windows:

```
cd ui
set "REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3031" & set "PORT=3030" & npm run start-windows
```

### Deploying on a remote server (AWS, azure etc)

Create a config file under `./server/config` with the naming convention `<server-name>.config.yaml`. You are free to chose the `server-name`. 

Copy the content of `localhost.config.yaml` to a new file `<server-name>.config.yaml`, located at `./server/config`. ou are free to chose the `server-name`. 

Configfure `<server-name>.config.yaml` as follows:

```
apiDebug: true
password: '1234'
timeout: 600000
libPath: ./server/lib
contractsPath: ./contracts/
dataFilename: ./server/dapp/dapp.presets.yaml
deployFilename: ./server/config/<server-name>.deploy.yaml

# WARNING - extra strict syntax
# DO NOT change the nodes order
# node 0 is the default url for all single node api calls
nodes:
  - id: 0
    explorerUrl: 'http://<your-ip-or-dns>:9000'
    stratoUrl: 'http://<your-ip-or-dns>/strato-api'
    blocUrl: 'http://<your-ip-or-dns>/bloc/v2.2'
    searchUrl: 'http://<your-ip-or-dns>/cirrus'
```

Replace <server-name> with the name of your config file (excluding `config.yaml`) and `<your-ip-or-dns>` with the IP or the DNS name of your remote server and then run the following from the **project root**:

```
SERVER=<server-name> npm run deploy
```

On Windows:

```
set "SERVER=<local-ip>" & npm run deploy-windows
```

Here <local-ip> can be 127.0.0.1 or the local network ip.

#### Launching the API

From the project root (Linux, Mac and Windows):

```
npm run start
```

#### Launching the UI

```
cd ui
API_URL="http://<your-ip-or-dns>:3031" npm run start
```

On Windows:

```
cd ui
set "REACT_APP_API_URL=http://<your-ip-or-dns>:3031" & set "PORT=3030" & npm run start-windows
```

where `<your-ip-or-dns>` is the IP or DNS name of the remote machine. Eg: 

```
set "REACT_APP_API_URL=http://some.remote.cloudapp.provider.com:3031" & set "PORT=3030" & npm run start-windows
```

### Testing

```
npm run test
```

On Windows:

```
set "SERVER=<server-name>" & npm run test-windows
```

## Using the BlockApps Supply Chain Demo App

Open the app in the browser.

By default, application is running at http://localhost:3030/

### Logins for the app
The app comes pre loaded with four different users: `Buyer1`, `Buyer2`, `Supplier1`, `Supplier2`. All these users have the same password: `1234`.

### Bidding Flow Guide

- Buyer Logs in

- Buyer creates a project for suppliers to bid on
![Bidding2](http://i.imgur.com/xADXnrX.gif)

- Supplier logs in
![Bidding3](http://i.imgur.com/jNke2we.gif)

- Supplier makes a bid on the earlier project
![Bidding4](http://i.imgur.com/4msxzoR.gif)

- Buyer accepts early supplier bid

Note: After the buyer accepts the bid, 20 dollars from the buyer's account is taken and held by the smart contract but is still not disbursed until the product is accepted

- Supplier marks that the product is shipped
